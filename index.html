            >Interview: Twenty One Pilots On “Scaled And Icy”, The Dragon and
            Stealing From The Rock</b
          >
        </h1>

        <p>
          <em>Scaled and Icy</em> is a product of long-distance virtual sessions
          that find “the duo processing their upended routines along with the
          prevailing emotions of 2020 – anxiety, loneliness, boredom and doubt”.
          However, contrary to the overtly negative emotions felt, they’ve
          channeled it into something more positive. With a “more imaginative
          and bold approach” to songwriting, “Scaled and Icy” is “a collection
          of songs that push forward through setbacks and focus on the
          possibilities worth remembering”.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >1. We heard from Tyler’s interview with BBC that you recorded
            <em>“Shy Away”</em> with Josh being across the country, would you
            elaborate on that?</b
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Tyler: </b
          ><em>
            Yeah, so, Josh was living in LA and I am currently in Columbus,
            Ohio, where we’re both from. And when we were working on the record,
            Josh lived all the way over there, and yet we still figured out a
            way to collaborate using video conferencing and screen sharing.
            Sometimes it was tough, but other times it made things very smooth
            and we’ll always wonder what the songs would have sounded like if we
            didn’t collaborate in that way. But I think that they turned out
            really well.</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >2. In your latest single “Shy Away”, it starts with a cooing noise
            courtesy of your baby daughter. Has fatherhood changed how you view
            music? Would you want to incorporate more of your children in music
            making in the future?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Tyler:</b
          ><em>
            It’s a good question. So, like mentioned in the background of “Shy
            Away”, in the beginning you hear a noise and that’s actually my
            daughter. She’s a little over one years old, and I don’t know… I
            guess it’s changed the way I view music and the way in (which) I
            like to look for opportunities to add meaning to songs, and the
            simple fact that she, my daughter, Rosie makes a noise in the
            background and it’s a part of the song. In that sense, it’s made the
            song more important to me. And so yeah, in that way, it’s
            changed.</em

            previous works, why move towards this change of sound?</b

        <p>
          <b>Tyler:</b
          ><em>
            (jokingly) Because why not? No, it’s a good question. I don’t know…
            I think that obviously, things are really tough, you know, on a
            global level, as far as the pandemic and, you know, at times very
            dismal and we recognise that it didn’t feel quite right to write a
            record that mirrored that reality. It felt more compelling and
            inspiring to write something that combated it and was the opposite
            of (it). And so, that’s why the record is very imaginative, it’s
            very colourful and very hopeful, and I think that it helped me get
            through this past year, and I hope that it can help some others as
            well.</em

          <b
            >4. What is the driving force behind the sound of Twenty One Pilots?
            I hear the connection between the new songs and your previous hits,
            but there’s an evolution in them as well. What makes for this
            evolving sound that stays true to your core?</b

        <p>
          <b>Tyler:</b
          ><em>
            Oh man, that’s a tough one. I would say Josh and I grew up playing
            music on a local level with so many different types of bands. And so
            we were just greatly influenced by a lot of bands, not just bands we
            listened to, but bands we played with even when we first started.
            And I think the question that Josh and I always ask each other when
            making music is “Do we like this? Do you like this? Do I like this?”
            It’s really it.</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >Sometimes the evolution of what we do next is purely decided on
            whether or not we answer that question with, “Yes, we do like this,
            we enjoy this,”. And I think that you’d be surprised how many
            artists and bands out there don’t necessarily enjoy their own style
            of music. It’s just what it is that they do, but they kind of maybe
            listen to something else. That’s not the case for us, we make music
            that we like.</em

        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >5. Is there any story behind the album cover’s artwork ? How does
            it relate to your music?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tyler:</b
          ><em>
            What does it mean? This record represents creativity, and that’s why
            the songs and the artwork in the album cover and the colours— it’s a
            lot more colourful. We wanted to make sure that even though we felt
            confined to one space, you know, a lot of times we’re writing songs
            while travelling, while touring, and that wasn’t the case this time,
            we were kind of like most of the world, confined to one space. And I
            just wanted to make sure that Josh and I didn’t feel confined
            musically, and so we may be overcompensated and just to push those
            walls out.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >We wrote something that was more colourful and more imaginative and
            this dragon really does represent that imagination. You know, to me,
            it was flying around the room, about to disintegrate me at any
            moment while I was making these songs. Something that intense can
            absolutely influence and keep you on your toes, in a reality that’s
            otherwise maybe a little bit dull. And so this dragon— his name is
            Trash— he was equal parts inspiration, equal parts fear, (and) in
            equal parts, magical. And I think that I wanted to tie the songs to
            something as powerful as that and that’s why it’s on the record.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >6. Why did you choose the dragon to symbolise imagination in
            particular with this new era? Does it have something to do with your
            love for fantasy like “Lord Of The Rings” or “Game of Thrones”?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tyler:</b>
          <em
            >Yeah, Josh and I, we love stories. I don’t know, I’m a sucker for
            stories. The word ‘scaled’ and ‘icy’ actually stands for ‘scale
            back’ and ‘isolated’, which is kind of how we all found ourselves
            this past year— scaled back and isolated. And so I took those two
            words that were very, I dunno, negative. And I tried to put a spin
            on it that was the opposite of (it), and when I thought of ‘scaled
            and icy’, which is shortened versions of the word scaled back and
            isolated, I just immediately thought of this dragon. And so he
            really brings home why we named the record “Scaled and Icy” and I
            think that when you listen to the full record, it’ll start to make
            sense.</em

          <b>7. Your album “Blurryface” was considered as the band’s breakthrough album. With your new album “Scaled and Icy” slated to come out this month, do you feel a certain pressure to match or even surpass the achievements achieved by “Blurryface” with the new one?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Josh:</b>
          <em>Yeah, I think you’re right. I mean, you know, we’ve technically been a band longer since before “Blurryface”, but you’re right. I think there were so many new people listening to that album and discovering our band through that album. And I think Tyler and I both know and understand that there’s really nothing that compares to when you first discover a band; that kind of feeling that you have and the tie emotionally. And so understanding that, I think, (can) already make it pretty difficult, and definitely put pressure on anything that you release after that because those people who have discovered you (are) invested kind of emotionally on that level.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Anything you put out after that is going to be judged a lot more critically, and I know that from experience, being on the other end. (I’ve seen) some of my favourite bands that I fall in love with, with an album, and then albums that they put out after that— I’m always just like, it just that first album was just something really incredible. But those bands that Tyler and I have always loved, that continue to put out music— You can just tell that they love music, love creating, and they love putting together an album and telling stories. Those albums; the more that we listen to them, the more we fall in love with those as well.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To go on a journey with a band is something really special. So while I do think that there is some pressure, because we understand that special connection with people’s first time listening to our band, it’s exciting to go on a journey of our own, and it’s exciting for us to try and grow musically and continue to try to outdo ourselves. You know with albums and concerts— I think this upcoming album is probably my favourite one of ours so far. And so I think that’s always a good sign, you know. I hope it’s you guys’ favourite too. But, we’ll find that out (shortly) I guess.</em>
