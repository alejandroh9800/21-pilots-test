        <h> <b>Interview: Twenty One Pilots On “Scaled And Icy”, The Dragon and Stealing From The Rock</b></h>
        
    <p>
      <em>Scaled and Icy</em> is a product of long-distance virtual sessions that find “the duo processing their upended routines along with the prevailing emotions of 2020 – anxiety, loneliness, boredom and doubt”. However, contrary to the overtly negative emotions felt, they’ve channeled it into something more positive. With a “more imaginative and bold approach” to songwriting, “Scaled and Icy” is “a collection of songs that push forward through setbacks and focus on the possibilities worth remembering”.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        <b>1. We heard from Tyler’s interview with BBC that you recorded <em>“Shy Away”</em> with Josh being across the country, would you elaborate on that?</b>
      </p>
        
      <p>
        <b>Tyler: </b><em> Yeah, so, Josh was living in LA and I am currently in Columbus, Ohio, where we’re both from. And when we were working on the record, Josh lived all the way over there, and yet we still figured out a way to collaborate using video conferencing and screen sharing.
        Sometimes it was tough, but other times it made things very smooth and we’ll always wonder what the songs would have sounded like if we didn’t collaborate in that way. But I think that they turned out really well.</em></p>
    
          <p><b>2. In your latest single “Shy Away”, it starts with a cooing noise courtesy of your baby daughter. Has fatherhood changed how you view music? Would you want to incorporate more of your children in music making in the future?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        <b> Tyler:</b><em> It’s a good question. So, like mentioned in the background of “Shy Away”, in the beginning you hear a noise and that’s actually my daughter. She’s a little over one years old, and I don’t know… I guess it’s changed the way I view music and the way in (which) I like to look for opportunities to add meaning to songs, and the simple fact that she, my daughter, Rosie makes a noise in the background and it’s a part of the song. In that sense, it’s made the song more important to me. And so yeah, in that way, it’s changed.</em>

        <p><b>3. Your latest single is more upbeat with synth riffs than your previous works, why move towards this change of sound?</b></p>
        
        
        <p><b>Tyler:</b><em> (jokingly) Because why not? No, it’s a good question. I don’t know… I think that obviously, things are really tough, you know, on a global level, as far as the pandemic and, you know, at times very dismal and we recognise that it didn’t feel quite right to write a record that mirrored that reality. It felt more compelling and inspiring to write something that combated it and was the opposite of (it). And so, that’s why the record is very imaginative, it’s very colourful and very hopeful, and I think that it helped me get through this past year, and I hope that it can help some others as well.</em> </p>
                
        <p><b>4. What is the driving force behind the sound of Twenty One Pilots? I hear the connection between the new songs and your previous hits, but there’s an evolution in them as well. What makes for this evolving sound that stays true to your core?</b></p>
        
        <p><b>Tyler:</b><em> Oh man, that’s a tough one. I would say Josh and I grew up playing music on a local level with so many different types of bands. And so we were just greatly influenced by a lot of bands, not just bands we listened to, but bands we played with even when we first started. And I think the question that Josh and I always ask each other when making music is “Do we like this? Do you like this? Do I like this?” It’s really it.</em> </p>
        
        <p><em>Sometimes the evolution of what we do next is purely decided on whether or not we answer that question with,  “Yes, we do like this, we enjoy this,”. And I think that you’d be surprised how many artists and bands out there don’t necessarily enjoy their own style of music. It’s just what it is that they do, but they kind of maybe listen to something else. That’s not the case for us, we make music that we like.</em> </p>
        <p><b>5. Is there any story behind the album cover’s artwork ? How does it relate to your music?</b></p>
