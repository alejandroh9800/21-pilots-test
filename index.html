      Scaled and Icy is a product of long-distance virtual sessions that find “the duo processing their upended routines along with the prevailing emotions of 2020 – anxiety, loneliness, boredom and doubt”. However, contrary to the overtly negative emotions felt, they’ve channeled it into something more positive. With a “more imaginative and bold approach” to songwriting, “Scaled and Icy” is “a collection of songs that push forward through setbacks and focus on the possibilities worth remembering”.1. We heard from Tyler’s interview with BBC that you recorded “Shy Away” with Josh being across the country, would you elaborate on that?

Tyler: Yeah, so, Josh was living in LA and I am currently in Columbus, Ohio, where we’re both from. And when we were working on the record, Josh lived all the way over there, and yet we still figured out a way to collaborate using video conferencing and screen sharing.

Sometimes it was tough, but other times it made things very smooth and we’ll always wonder what the songs would have sounded like if we didn’t collaborate in that way. But I think that they turned out really well.
